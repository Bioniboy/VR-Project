Welcome to our VR Project, called Sandman: Protector of Dreams. In it, you use magic and a sword in order to defeat nightmares. If enough nightmares get past, you lose. 

Hit enemies with your sword to knock them back. Pick up the little blue orb next to you and hold trigger to shoot a laser blast. You get one point for defeating the little enemies, and 3 points for the big ones. You can see your score on the hilt of your sword.
