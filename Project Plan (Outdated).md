# We’re going to make a VR game. This will involve learning technology in C#, Unity, and Blender. We’ll learn how to port it to both Steam VR and Quest. This will be a good opportunity to learn to work with a fairly new technology. Our starting idea for a project is to make a card game simulator, where you’ll have cards in one hand, and with the other you’ll be able to pick specific ones up and put them down in place on the table. We’re considering using one of the last sprints to learn to implement multiplayer.
